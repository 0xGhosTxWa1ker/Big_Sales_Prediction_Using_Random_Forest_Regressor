**Big Sales Prediction using Random Forest Regressor**

**Project Overview**
This project, completed as part of my internship with YBI Foundation, aims to predict sales figures for a retail business using historical sales data. By leveraging the Random Forest Regressor algorithm, the model provides accurate sales forecasts, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions and optimize various aspects of their operations, including inventory management, marketing strategies, and sales performance.

**Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts future sales based on historical data. The model will help retail businesses forecast sales, identify key factors influencing sales, and improve overall decision-making processes.

**Tech Stack**

  Programming Language:
  
      Python

  Libraries Used:
  
      pandas for data manipulation and analysis
      
      numpy for numerical operations
      
      scikit-learn for building and evaluating the Random Forest Regressor model
      
      matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
      
      Jupyter Notebook for development and presentation
      

**Steps Involved**
  Data Collection: Acquired historical sales data and relevant features.
  
  Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
  
  Model Building: Developed the Random Forest Regressor model using the training data.
  
  Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
  
  Prediction: Used the trained model to predict future sales.

**Results**

Model Performance:

  Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 829.5091250445333
  
  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1620186.069956401
